This emacs folder sits in my AeroFS folder (Linux/OSX/Windows) with the
following in my .emacs file:

- (add-to-list 'load-path â€œ~/AeroFS/emacs-init")
- (load "init")

init.el
-------
- does add-to-list and load-path for stuff in the vendor folder
- loads stuff from the user folder

user folder
-----------
- contains system specific initialization files, e.g. bindings.el, require.el, global.el, env.el
- contains files for setting/configuring items in the vendor folder

vendor folder
-------------
- some add-on functionality


I don't have Dropbox running on all the machines I work on, e.g. lab computers at work, so I keep a copy on Github for easy access.
